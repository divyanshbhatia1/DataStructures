# Data Structures

Implementation of various Data Structure algorithms

## Tree
#### Terminology: 
- Tree
- Node
- Root
- Edge
- Leaf
- Depth - Distance from Root to node
- Height - Distance from leaf to node
- Level - Root is at Level 0, it's children are at level 1 and so on..
- Ancestor
- Children

#### Binary Tree:
- 0, 1, 2 children
- Left and Right child
- Complete Binary tree
- Full Binary tree - All have 2 children
	
#### Binary Search Tree:
- Insertion, Deletion, Retrieval in O(log N)
- Left smaller than parent, right larger
	
#### Advanced Topics:
- Self-Balancing Trees
- AVL, Red-Black Tree

#### Operations:
1. Add
2. Traversals:
	- Level: Visit nodes on each level
	- Pre-order: Visit root first (Root, Left, Right)
	- Post-order: Visit root last (Left, Right,  Root)
	- In-order: Visit left, root, right (Returns sorted data)
3. Search
4. Min
5. Max
6. Delete
7. 
## Array
#### Operations:
1. Search
    1. LinearSearch
    2. BinarySearch
    3. JumpSearch
2. Sort
    1. JumpSearch
    2. JumpSearch
    3. InsertionSort
    4. MergeSort
    5. HeapSort
## LinkedList
#### Operations:
1. AddFirst
2. AddLast
3. AddAfterMiddle
4. RemoveFirst
5. RemoveLast
6. RemoveAfterMiddle
7. RemoveWhere
8. Length
## Queue
#### Operations:
1. Pop
2. Push
## Stack
#### Operations:
1. Pop
2. Push
